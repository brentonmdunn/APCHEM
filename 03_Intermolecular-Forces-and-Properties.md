## 3.1 Intermolecular Forces

### London Dispersion Forces

London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. 

- Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules.
- The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecules and the size of the electron cloud (<u>**larger electron cloud –> more polarizable and greater the strength of the electrons(?)**</u>). Thus, the larger the molecule the stronger the London dispersion forces are. It is also enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. 
- The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term 
  “van der Waals forces.”

### Dipole-Dipole and Ion-Dipole Interactions

The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species.

-  Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between polar and nonpolar molecules. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule.
-  Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are type all greater than those between nonpolar molecules with comparable size because these interactions act in addition or London dispersion forces.
- Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipole-dipole forces.

The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole.

### Hydrogen Bonding

Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of the dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule.

In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule.

### Properties That Increase as Intermolecular Forces Increase

- Melting point and boiling point
- Surface tension
- Viscosity
- Heat of Vaporization 

### Properties That Decrease as Intermolecular Forces Increase

- Vapor pressure (pressure exerted by a gas when it is at equilibrium with its liquid)
- Volatility (ease of evaporation)

### Comparing the Magnitude of Intermolecular Forces

- If the size of the molecule is comparable, similar atoms, similar molar mass, then hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > LDF
- If the molecules vary in size, it is more difficult to compare the relative strength s of intermolecular forces, as LDF could become more significant than dipole-dipole and even hydrogen bonding.

## 3.2 Properties of Solids **

Many properties are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance evaporates, the vapor pressure and the boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, the relations can be more subtle.

Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent.

In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a 3-D network (e.g., diamond) or layers of 2-D layers (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. 3-D network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. 

Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bond and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers.

Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Allys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting.

In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions.

### Properties of Ionic Solids

- Formed by a cation (+) (usually metal) and a nonmetal anion (-) each type surrounded by the other in a 3-D lattice structure
- Formula represents ratio between ions
- High melting and boiling point due to strong net attraction between ions
- Brittle
- Poor conductors of electricity in the solid state but good conductors when liquid and aqueous (if soluble) – ions must be free to flow for it to conduct

#### Why are Ionic Solids Brittle?

An impact moves the lattice so that some atoms are no longer alternating. This causes them to repel each other and eventually cleave off.

### Properties of Molecular Solids

- Formed by distinct individual neutral molecules which in turn form molecular lattice structures
- Formed exclusively of non-metal atoms
- Formula represents actual number of atoms in each individual molecules
- Relatively low melting point and boiling point due to the weak intermolecular forces holding molecules together
- Poor conductors of electricity in all states as electrons are held tightly in covalent bonds

### Properties of Covalent Network Solids

- Formed by distinct atoms all bonded together covalently in a 3-D network
- Formed by carbon and semimetals such as silicon, germanium, boron, etc
- Very high melting point
- Very high hardness
- Poor conductors of electricity as electrons are held tightly in covalent bonds
- Examples: SiO~2~, SiC, BC

#### Covalent Network Solids – Graphite

- A more common and affordable allotrope of carbon (compared to diamond)
- Carbon in graphite is sp^2^ hybridized and form very large sheets of trigonal planar carbon atoms
- Weak intermolecular forces hold sheets together so graphite is soft as lawyers can slide past each other
- Excellent conductor of electricity as delocalized electrons can flow on top and below graphite sheets

### Properties of Metallic Solids

- Formed by metallic elements
- Exhibit metallic bonding where valence electrons are free to flow from atom to atom (sea of electrons)
- Great conductors of heat and electricity
- Malleable and ductile
- Melting points vary; depend on metal

## 3.3 Solids, Liquids, and Gases

Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular 3-D structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together.

The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles.

The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times.

In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequency of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape

> Do not need to understand nor interpret phase diagrams

### Solid Water

- Below 0°C, water molecules are locked in place
- Molecules are moving but not around each other
- Molecules in a solid are not necessarily closer to each other then when they are in a liquid 

### Liquid Water

- Above water’s melting point, water molecules are moving too fast for their mutual attraction to maintain them locked in place
- Molecules are able to slide past one another
- The molecules at the surface may evaporate

### Gaseous Water

- Above 100°C, attraction between water molecules is not significant
- Molecules in the gas phase move randomly in straight lines between collisions

## 3.4 Ideal Gas Law

### Effect of Volume (V) on Pressure (P)

As volume decreases, pressure increases. Pressure and volume are inversely proportional. 
$$
P\propto \frac 1 V
$$

### Effect of Moles (n) on Pressure (P)

As the amount of molecules increases, the number of collisions increase. Pressure is directly proportional to the amount of particles.
$$
P\propto n
$$

### Effect of Temperature (T) on Pressure (P)

As the average kinetic energy of the molecules increases, pressure increases because collisions occur more often and are more energetic. Pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature (K)
$$
P \propto T
$$

### Ideal Gas Law

Combining all proportionalities between gas properties.
$$
P\propto \frac{nT}V
$$

Proportionality constant = R (aka ideal gas constant)
$$
PV=nRT
$$

> P = pressure (atm)
>
> V = volume (L)
>
> n = moles
>
> R = ideal gas constant
>
> T = temperature (K)

### Partial Pressure

In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the same is the sum of the partial pressures.
$$
P_{total}=P_A+P_B+P_C+...
$$

### Mole Fraction

A mole fraction is the ration of the moles of one gas in the mixture to the total number of moles.
$$
X_A=\frac{n_A}{n_{total}}
$$
Because partial pressure is direly proportional to moles…
$$
X_A=\frac{n_A}{n_{total}}=\frac{P_A}{P_{total}}\\
P_A=P_{total}\times X_A
$$

> X~A~ = moles A/total moles

## 3.5 Kinetic Molecular Theory

The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: 
$$
T_{Kelvin}\propto\ce{KE=1/2mv^2}
$$

> T~Kelvin~ = temperature in Kelvin
>
> m = mass (kilograms)
>
> v =  velocity (meters/second)
>
> KE = kinetic energy (joules)

The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/velocities of particles at a given temperature.

### Observations of Particles

- Particles are in continuous random motion
- Between collisions, particles have constant velocity and direction
- After collisions, particles have a new velocity and direction
- As particles collide, they don't stick – elastic collisions

### Looking at Two Different Particles of Different Sizes

- Lighter particles move faster
- Despite different average motion, temperature is the same
- Kelvin temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy of the particles 

### Does Molecular Size Matter?

A larger particle would technically travel a shorter distance between collision and would collide more often than a smaller particle. When the containers are significantly larger, particle size becomes negligible. Ideality in gases assume that combined particle volume is zero.

### Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. 

Cold gases result in thin, tall curves while hot gases result in short, wide curves.

Heavy gases will result in thin, tall curves while light gases result in short, wide curves.

## 3.6 Deviation from Ideal Gas Law

The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from the interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting from constipation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at exactly high pressures.

### Real Gas Behavior

- All gases are able to condense; there are attractive forces
- Molecules vary in size and <u>do</u> have volume
- In this case, $PV\neq nRT$

### How Come PV is not nRT?

This assumes particles have no attraction. With significant attraction, the number of collisions decrease and actual pressure would be less than in an ideal setting.

### Effect of Intermolecular Forces

At high temperatures, intermolecular forces are negligible and gas behaves ideally. At low temperatures, intermolecular forces become significant and gas is non ideal. Intermolecular forces increase, and the actual pressure is smaller than predicted. 

### Effect of Molecular Volume

With significant particle volume, the number of collisions increase and actual pressure would be greater than in an ideal setting.

### Decreasing Volume of Container

As volume of the container becomes smaller, the particle volume becomes more significant, leading to greater pressure than predicted.

### Effect of Particle Volume

At low pressures, the space between molecules is much greater than the volume of molecules themselves and the gas behaves ideally. At high pressures, the particle volume becomes significant and the gas is non ideal. As the particle volume becomes significant, actual pressure is greater than predicted.

### Summary of When Gases are Non Ideal

- Low temperatures
- High pressures
- Particles with significant intermolecular forces
- Pericles with significant molecular size

## 3.7 Solutions and Mixtures

Solution (aka homogeneous mixtures) can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture.

Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory.
$$
M=\frac{n_{solute}}{L_{solution}}
$$

> M = molarity
>
> n = moles of solute
>
> L = liters of solution

Dilution formula:
$$
M_1V_1=M_2V_2
$$


## 3.8 Representations of Solutions

Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components.

> Do not need to know colligative properties and calculations of molarity, percent by mass, and percent by volume.

## 3.9 Separation of Solutions and Mixtures Chromatography

The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in intermolecular interactions of the components.

- Chromatography (paper, thin-layered, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase.
  - The solution, or mobile phase, will have a certain amount of intermolecular attraction to the surface components of the paper or column due to differences in polarity. The more polar a component of the solution, the less interaction it will have with a nonpolar stationary phase 
  - The less polar component of the solution, the more interaction it will have with a nonpolar stationary phase 
- Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture.

### Summary

Chromatography takes advantage of different polarities and distillation takes advantage of different boiling points.

## 3.10 Solubility

Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another.

### “Like Dissolves Like”

Nonpolar solutes dissolve in nonpolar solvents and polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents. Ionic compounds will tend to dissolve in polar solvents because cations interact with the negative dipoles of water molecules while anions interact with the positive dipoles. Molecular compounds that do not have dipoles and have predominately London dispersion forces will tend to dissolve in nonpolar solvents. The larger and more polarizable electron cloud, the more interactions will occur with the solvent.

## 3.11 Spectroscopy and the Electromagnetic Spectrum

Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transmission:

- Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels.
- Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels.
- Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels.

## 3.12 Photoelectric Effect

When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon.

The wavelength of an electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation:
$$
c=\lambda\nu
$$

> c = speed of light = $2.998\times 10^8 ms^{-1}$
>
> $\lambda$ = wavelength
>
> $\nu$ = frequency 

The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Plank’s equation.
$$
E=h\nu
$$

> E = energy
>
> h = Plank’s constant = $6.626\times 10^{-34}Js$
>
> $\nu$ = frequency

## 3.13 Beer-Lambert Law

The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: 
$$
A=\epsilon bc
$$

> A = absorption
>
> $\epsilon$ = molar absorptivity (describes how intensely a sample of molecules of ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength)
>
> b = path length
>
> c = concentration

The path length and concentration are proportional to the number of absorbing species. In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions.
