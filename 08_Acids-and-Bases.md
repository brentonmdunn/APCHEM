# Acids and Bases

## 8.1 Introduction to Acids and Bases

### $pH$ and $pOH$

The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as $pH$ and $pOH$, respectively.
$$
pH=-log[H_3O^+]\\
[H_3O^+]=10^{-pH}
$$

$$
pOH=-log[OH^-]\\
[OH^-]=10^{-pOH}
$$

> The terms “hydrogen ion and “hydronium ion” and the symbols $H^+_{(aq)}$ and $H_3O^+_{(aq)}$ are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion and $H_3O^+_{(aq)}$ are preferred, but $H^+_{(aq)}$ is also accepted on the AP Exam.

$[H3O^+]>[OH^-]$ = acidic

$[H3O^+]=[OH^-]$ = neutral

$[H3O^+]<[OH^-]$ = basic

### Water Autoionization 

Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant $K_w$.
$$
\ce{2H2O_{(l)}\rightleftharpoons H3O+_{(aq)}+OH-_{(aq)}}
$$

$$
K_w=[H_3O^+][OH^-]=1.0\times 10^{-14}\;at\;25^{\circ}C
$$

In pure water, $pH = pOH$ is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, $pK_w=14.0$ and thus $pOH=pOH=7.0$.
$$
pH+pOH=14
$$
The value of $K_w$ is temperature dependent, so the $pH$ of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C.

### Estimating $pH$

If $1.00\times 10^{-x}$:

- $pH=|power|=x$

If $a.bc\times 10^{-x}$:

- $pH=|x-1|.something$

### Temperature Dependence of $K_w$

As temperature increases, $K_w$ increases. The reaction shifts to form product and consume reactant. Temperature favors the endothermic direction. The autoionization of water is therefore an endothermic reaction. As temperature increases, the $pH$ value of pure water decreases.

## 8.2 $pH$ and $pOH$ of Strong Acids and Bases

Molecules of a strong acid (e.g, $HCl$, $HBr$, $HI$, $HClO_4$, $H_2SO_4$, and $HNO_3$) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such the concentration of $H_3O^+$ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the $pH$ of the strong acid solution is easily calculated.

> Memorize strong acids: $HCl$, $HBr$, $HI$, $HClO_4$, $H_2SO_4$, and $HNO_3$

When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and group II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of $OH^-$ in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the $pOH$ (and $pH$ of the strong base solution is easily calculated.

## 8.3 Weak Acid and Base Equilibria 

Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize this way, in other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of $H_3O^+$ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized.

A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_a$, often reported as $pK_a$. The $pH$ of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the $pK_a$.
$$
K_a=\frac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA]}
$$

$$
pK_a=-log\;K_a
$$

> Can ignore x in [HA] - x

Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinary just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thu, the concentration of OH^-^ in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized.

A solution of weak base involves equilibrium between un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_b$, often reported as $pK_b$. The $pH$ of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the $pK_b$.
$$
K_b=\frac{[OH^-][HB^+]}{[B]}
$$

$$
pK_b=-log\;K_b
$$

The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its $pK_a$ ($pK_b$) and the initial concentration of the acid (base).

### Weak Acid Equilibrium

$$
pK_a+pK_b=14\;at\;25^{\circ}
$$

$$
pK_a\times pK_b=1\times 10^{-14}\;at\;25^{\circ}
$$

### Percent Ionization

$$
\%ionization =\frac{[H_3O^+]_{equilibrium}}{[HA]_{iniital}}\times 100\;\;\;\;OR\;\;\;\;\%ionization =\frac{[OH^-]_{equilibrium}}{[B^-]_{iniital}}\times 100
$$

Percent ionization increases as molarity decreases.

## 8.4 Acid-Base Reactions and Buffers

### Steps for Acid-Base Neutralization Reactions

1. Dilution
   - Adding volume to volume requires $V_1M_1=V_2M_2$
2. Stoichiometry 
   - Any strength acid + base will proceed to make product until the limting reagent runs out
   - Before > Shift > After table
3. Equilibrium (if needed)
   - If weak acids or bases are involved, then may need to do equilibrium calculation
   - ICE table 
4. Find $pH$
   - Plug values from ICE table into $K_a$ or $K_b$ equations to find $[H^+]$ or $[OH^-]$ then use to find $pH$

### Strong Acid and Strong Base

When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: 
$$
H^+_{(aq)}+OH^-_{(aq)}\rightarrow H_2O_{(l)}
$$
The $pH$ of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of the excess reagent.

### Weak Acid and Strong Base

When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: 
$$
HA_{(aq)}+OH^-_{(aq)}\rightleftharpoons A^-_{(aq)}+ H_2O_{(l)}
$$
If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the $pH$ can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. If the strong base is in excess, then the $pH$ can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) $pH$ can be determined from the equation represented by the equation: 
$$
A^-_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}\rightleftharpoons HA_{(aq)}+OH^-_{(aq)}
$$

### Strong Acid and Weak Base

When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react entity in a reaction represented by the equation: 
$$
B_{(aq)}+H_3O_{(aq)}^+\rightleftharpoons HB^+_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}
$$
If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the $pH$ can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the $pH$ can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly) acidic $pH$ can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation:
$$
HB^+_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}\rightleftharpoons B_{(aq)}+H_3O^+_{(aq)}
$$

### Weak Acid and Weak Base

When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation:
$$
HA_{(aq)}+B_{(aq)}\rightleftharpoons A^-_{(aq)}+HB^+_{(aq)}
$$

### Half Equivalence Point

A half equivalence point is when you neutralize half of the reaction (has to have a weak acid or base). This occurs when $[acid]=\frac 1 2 [base]$ (or vice versa). You know that you are at the half equivalence point when, after the BSA table, the acid/base values will be the same. At this point, you can use the following equations to calculate $pH$/$pOH$:
$$
pH=pK_a
$$

$$
pOH=pK_b
$$

## 8.5 Acid-Base Titrations

An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting $pH$ against the volume of titrant added, is useful in summarizing results from a titration. 

At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of analyte. This is the case for titrations of song acids/bases and weak acids/bases.

For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid $[HA] = [A^-]$. Because $pH=pK_a$ when the conjugate acid and base have equal concentrations, the $pK_a$ can be determined from the $pH$ at the equivalence half-equivalence point in a titration.

For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the $pK_a$ associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid.

> Will not be assessed on the computation of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids.

### Titration Curve of a Weak Acid ($HQ$) and Strong Base

- When 0 base has been added, the $pH$ is >0 (it is at equilibrium)
-  Before half equivalence point: $[HQ]>[Q^-]$
- At half equivalence point: $[HQ]=[Q^-]$
- After half equivalence point: $[HQ]<[Q^-]$
- The region around the equivalence is the buffer zone
  - Contains the weak acid ($HQ$) and its conjugate base ($Q^-$) and resists change in $pH$ upon addition of $OH^-$
- The equivalence point is when the amount of titrant and analyte are equimolar
  - The $pH$ at the equivalence point of a weak acid is slightly basic because it is directed by the conjugate base, not because we are using a strong base
  - Strong acids have non-reacting conjugate bases so the autodissociation of water directs the $pH$
- As strength of acid decreases: (assume same starting molarity)
  - The starting $pH$ increases
  - The bigger the jump is to the buffer zone
  - Because acid strength decreases, conjugate base strength increases

### Titration Curve of a Strong Acid and Weak Base ($Y$)

- When 0 acid has been added, the $pH$ is a little less than 14 (it is as equilibrium)
- Before half equivalence point: $[Y]>[HY^+]$
- At half equivalence point: $[Y]=[HY^+]$
- After half equivalence point: $[Y]<[HY^+]$
- The region around the equivalence is the buffer zone
  - Contains weak base ($Y$) and its conjugate acid ($HY^+$)
- The equivalence point is when the amount of titrant and analyte are equimolar
  - The $pH$ at the equivalence point of a weak base is slightly acidic because it is directed by the conjugate acid, not because we are using a strong acid
- As strength of base decreases: (assume same starting molarity)
  - The starting $pH$ decreases
  - The bigger drop to buffer zone
  - Lower $pH$ at equivalence point
  - Because the base strength decreases, conjugate acid strength increases

## 8.6 Molecular Structure of Acids and Bases

NEED MORE HELP

Strong acids have weak H–X bonds (such as $HCl$), and weaker acids have stronger H–X bonds (such as $HF$). Oxoacids, or oxyacids, contain an atom bonded to one or more oxygen atoms, sometimes with hydrogen atoms attached. The inductive effect occurs when electrons in bonds are attracted by more electronegative atoms.

The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure.

- Strong acids (such as $HCl$, $HBr$, $HI$, $HClO_4$, $H_2SO_4$, and $HNO_3$), have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or other combination thereof.
- Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid.
- Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids.
- Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions.
- Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acids, and so increase acid strength.

## 8.7 $pH$ and $pK_a$

The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentration of HA and A^-^) can be produced by comparing the $pH$ of a solution to the $pK_a$ of the acid in the at solution. 

When solution $pH$ < acid $pK_a$, the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When the solution $pH$ > acid $pK_a$, the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form.

Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their proton state versus deprotonated state, making the property respond to the $pH$ of a solution.

## 8.8 Properties of Buffers

A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize $pH$.

## 8.9 Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

The $pH$ of the buffer is related to the $pK_a$ of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of $\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ and thus does not significantly change the solution of $pH$. The change in $pH$ of addition of an acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the butter.
$$
pH=pK_a+log\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}
$$

> Will not be passed on computation of the change $pH$ resulting from the addition of an acid or a base to a buffer.
>
> Will not be assessed on the derivation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

## 8.10 Buffer Capacity

A buffer should be able to control $pH$ after the addition of reasonable amounts of acid and base. The important thing in determining the $pH$ of a buffer solution is the relative number of moles of acid and conjugate base. Diluting a buffer solution does not change its $pH$.

Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the $pH$ of these buffers the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base.

A buffer solution should control the $pH$ at the desired value. Choose an acid with $K_a$ close to the intended value of $[H_3O^+]$. The exact value of $[H_3O^+]$ can be achieved by adjusting the acid/conjugate base ratio. The H–H equation can be used to determine the ideal ratio of conjugate base to acid concentration.

When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base.
