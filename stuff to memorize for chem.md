# stuff to memorize for chem

- K~SP~ ratios

| Ion Ratio | K~sp~ in terms of molar solubility “S” |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------: |
|    1:1    |         $K_{sp}=S\times S=S^2$         |
|    1:2    |      $K_{sp}=S\times (2S)^2=4S^3$      |
|    1:3    |     $K_{sp}=S\times (3S)^3=27S^4$      |
|    2:3    |  $K_{sp}=(2S)^2\times (3S)^3=108S^5$   |

- faraday law stoich problems 
  - find moles of electrons per moles of atom
  - $I=\frac q t$
    - $I$ is in amps
    - $q$ is charge and is in coulombs
    - $t$ is time in seconds
    - also written as $q=I \times t$
      - $\frac {1c}{1A\times 1 s}$
- naming conventions
  - non-metal | non-metal
    - prefixes
  - metal | non-metal
    - no prefixes needed
    - metal then non-metal
    - make sure to include valence electrons for transition metals
  - acids
    - no oxygen	
      - hydro__ acid
      - ex: HF
        - hydrofluoric acid
    - -ite
      - __ous acid
      - ex: HNO~2~
        - nitrous acid
    - -ate
      - __ic acid
      - ex: HNO~3~
        - nitric acid
- common polyatomic ions (see quizlet or anki)
- solubility
  - All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water.
  - can memorize the rest if want to 
- VSEPR
  - SO SMTG
- ox numbers
  - 0 for free elements
  - ions is equal to its charge
  - hydrogen
    - +1 if in compound with nonmetals
    - -1 if in compound with metals
  - oxygen
    - -2 usually
    - +1 if paired with group 1
    - +2 if paired with group 2
    - -1 if oxide
  - 
- phase change names
  - solid -> liquid
    - melting/fusion
  - liquid -> gas
    - vaporization/evaporation
  - gas -> solid
    - deposition
  - gas -> liquid
    - condensation
  - solid -> gas
    - sublimation
  - liquid -> solid
    - solidiification/crysilistalization 
- atomic trends

- rate law shortcuts
  - 0th order
    - increase [ ] of reactants but rate does not change
  - 1st order
    - reactant is multiplied by $x$ and rate is also multiplied by $x$
  - 2nd order
    - reactant is multipled by $x$ and rate is multipled by 2^x^
- rate units ($M^{1-n}t^{-1}$)
- adding multiplying etc K~C~
  - adding
    - $K_{C1}\times K_{C2}$
  - reversing
    - $\frac 1 {K_C}$
  - divide by half
    - $\sqrt{K_C}$
  - multiple by 2
    - $(K_C)^2$
- strong acids/bases
  - $HCl$, $HBr$, $HI$, $HClO_4$, $H_2SO_4$, and $HNO_3$
  - $KOH$ and $NaOH$
- estimating pH
  - if $1\times 10^{-x}M$	
    - $pH=|power|=x$
  - if not 1 (ex: $8.45\times 10^{-x}$)
    - $pH=|power|-1.something$
    - ex: $4.45\times 10^{-9}$ = 8.something
- oxidation is at the anode and redcution is at the cathode
- $E^{\circ}_{cell}=E^{\circ}_{cathode}-E^{\circ}_{anode}$
- Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transmission:

  - Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels.
  - Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels.
  - Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels.



# things to relearn

- stuff collected over water
- average volity/rms
- bonds (hydrogen bonds > dipole dpipole > london disperson forces)
- molality
- WB equation
- how addition of salts affects pH
- cell potential and sponetinaity 

# random things to know

- 3rd row elements for expanded octet: valence electrons = number of bonds  
- num of bonds on central atom: find total electorns then % 8 (ONLY WITHOUT H)
- hydrogen bonds > dipole dpipole > london disperson forces
